# Context Optimization Techniques

Context optimization extends the effective capacity of limited context windows through strategic compression, masking, caching, and partitioning. The goal is not to magically increase context windows but to make better use of available capacity. Effective optimization can double or triple effective context capacity without requiring larger models or longer contexts.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:
- Context limits constrain task complexity
- Optimizing for cost reduction (fewer tokens = lower costs)
- Reducing latency for long conversations
- Implementing long-running agent systems
- Needing to handle larger documents or conversations
- Building production systems at scale

## Core Concepts

Context optimization extends effective capacity through four primary strategies: compaction (summarizing context near limits), observation masking (replacing verbose outputs with references), KV-cache optimization (reusing cached computations), and context partitioning (splitting work across isolated contexts).

The key insight is that context quality matters more than quantity. Optimization preserves signal while reducing noise. The art lies in selecting what to keep versus what to discard, and when to apply each technique.

## Detailed Topics

### Compaction Strategies

Compaction is the practice of summarizing context contents when approaching limits, then reinitializing a new context window with the summary. This distills the contents of a context window in a high-fidelity manner, enabling the agent to continue with minimal performance degradation.

### Observation Masking

Tool outputs can comprise 80%+ of token usage in agent trajectories. Observation masking replaces verbose tool outputs with compact references. The information remains accessible if needed but does not consume context continuously.

### KV-Cache Optimization

The KV-cache stores Key and Value tensors computed during inference, growing linearly with sequence length. Caching the KV-cache across requests sharing identical prefixes avoids recomputation.

### Context Partitioning

The most aggressive form of context optimization is partitioning work across sub-agents with isolated contexts. Each sub-agent operates in a clean context focused on its subtask without carrying accumulated context from other subtasks.

## Guidelines

1. Measure before optimizing—know your current state
2. Apply compaction before masking when possible
3. Design for cache stability with consistent prompts
4. Partition before context becomes problematic
5. Monitor optimization effectiveness over time
6. Balance token savings against quality preservation
7. Test optimization at production scale
8. Implement graceful degradation for edge cases
